# IMS Starter Project 

Created a project where I made a management system consisting of Customers, Items and Orders. 

## Getting Started

Forked the project from github.
Cloned the repo containing the project files.
Opened the project within Eclipse.
Created and moved into a Dev branch.

### Prerequisites

I had to install:
JUNIT Testing, Mockito testing by adding the dependencies into the pom.xml file.
The dependencies were found on https://mvnrepository.com/

I had to install MySQL (and Workbench) in order to have a database that I could use.

I had to install Git BASH to access and update the repo.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
